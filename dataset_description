Description of data set:

I choose this data set because I thought it would be interesting to see which countries are found to be the happiest.
Also, because I was able to arrange the data in ways that allowed me to see how some datapoints related to the
happiness rank. It was interesting to learn that a lot of countries that had cold weather were also found to be happier.
(Especially because I only like moderately cold weather) However, another reason that influenced me to choose this
dataset is because there were a lot of numbers and very few words. I thought that it may be an easier way to organize
and sort through. As I am completing the project I have seen that it is still very difficult.
